## Module 02 – Core Data Structures in JavaScript

### Goal
Be able to **implement and reason about** the most common interview data structures in plain JavaScript, from scratch.

You’ll focus on:
- Arrays & strings utilities (indexing, slicing, immutability vs mutation).
- Stack & Queue.
- Singly Linked List.
- Simple Hash Map / Set using buckets.

### What you will do
- Rebuild these structures **without using built-in shortcuts** (`Map`, `Set`, etc. when forbidden).
- Respect strict **Piscine-style constraints**.
- Think about:
  - **Time complexity** of each operation.
  - When each structure is **better** than a plain array or object.

Finishing this module means you can **confidently talk about implementation details** and not just use built-ins as black boxes.
