## Module 03 – Algorithm Basics

### Goal
Train on the **classic algorithm patterns** that show up everywhere in interviews:
- Binary search.
- Sorting.
- Recursion and divide-and-conquer.

You’ll implement these by hand, in plain JavaScript, and pay attention to:
- **Time and space complexity**.
- When each algorithm is appropriate.
- Edge cases (empty arrays, duplicates, already sorted input, etc.).

This module is about being able to **derive** and **explain** the algorithms, not just call built-ins.
