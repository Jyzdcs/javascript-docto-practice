## Module 01 – JavaScript Refresher

### Goal

Get comfortable again with modern JavaScript so that syntax or language quirks never block you during an algorithmic interview.

You’ll focus on:

- **Variables & scope** (`let`, `const`, `var`, block/function scope)
- **Functions & closures**
- **Higher-order functions** (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- **This / bind / arrow functions**
- **Async basics** (promises, `async` / `await`)

### What you will do

- Implement **small, focused programs** in plain Node.js (no frameworks).
- Respect strict **Piscine-like rules** (no extra libs, clean I/O, constraints).
- Practice **clear problem statements** + **disciplined coding** habits.

You don’t need to finish every exercise before moving to the next module, but try to at least:

- Be fully fluent with `let`/`const`, scopes and closures.
- Be able to write and explain a small program using callbacks and `async` / `await`.
