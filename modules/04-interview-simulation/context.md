## Module 04 – Interview Simulation & Reasoning

### Goal
Simulate **real interview conditions**: read a problem, think out loud, design a solution, then implement it cleanly in JavaScript.

You’ll focus on:
- A **step-by-step reasoning process** you can reuse in the real interview.
- Writing both **code** and a short **written explanation**.
- Handling edge cases, complexity, and trade-offs.

Each exercise will ask you to:
- Implement a solution in JS.
- Write a short `REASONING.md` following a strict template.
